# UNFINISHED
This application will not be finished because of design flaws. I wanted to use BlueTooth to allow devices to communicate and transfer information. But I was having problems while testing, so I decided to cancel this project.

# Why Did I Cancel?
The application was designed for none tech people. So if I was having problems with a feature (and I was the one to make the application). It would be 10 times worse if I sold it to a company and they had problems with the application. I just felt it wouldn't be professional.

# What did it do?
The applicaiton would allow the user to input information such as:
* Input hallway information suchas:
  1. Room numbers (min and max).
  2. Hallway name.
  
* Input room information:
  1. Residents first and last names.
  2. Diet restrictions.
  3. Any special restrictions that might not be as common.
  
* Create a weekly menu
  * I didn't fully implment this feature though.
  
* there is a pre-made menu where the user could select items and the application would update the order form.
  * there was supposed to be a weekly menu added to the applciation but that didn't happen because of the problems with BlueTooth.
  
# What Needed To Be Added?
Full BlueTooth functionality. I got a basic connection running. which would have then allowed the application to transfer information (such as order sheets or hallway/resident information from one device to the next).
